# Mars Weather

This project shows a few interesting details about the weather on Mars, specifically in the Elysium Planatia region. Elysium Planatia is a volcanic region on Mars, close to the planet's equator.

Now, the API provides a ton of interesting details, but I've narrowed it down to just a few key ones that I display. Here's what you'll find:

- ☀️Sol (which refers to the solar day on Mars.)
- 📅Date
- 🌡️Max and Min Temperature (in ℃ and ℉)
- 🌬️Avg Wind Speed (in kph and mph )
- 🧭Wind Direction

This Mars Weather project has been deployed on [Vercel](https://mars-weather-azure.vercel.app/).
